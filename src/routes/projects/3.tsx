            A logo and visuals were created that emphasize movement through dynamic
            elements. In addition to movement, the elements are part of the code, which
            represents Checkmarx&apos;s main direction. The word hackathon is a
            portmanteau of the words hacker, which means clever programmer, and marathon,
            an event marked by endurance. HTML is the code that is used to structure a web
            page and its content. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
            angle brackets. The hackathon atmosphere should be emphasized by using
            enthusiastic people who are passionate about the lesson.
